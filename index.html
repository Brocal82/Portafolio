      <h1>About me</h1>
      <div class="border">
        <p>
          Born and raised in Spain. My curiosity led me to fly to England, where I spent over a decade working and meeting people from every corner of the world. However, the desire to pursue further education brought me back to Spain, where I completed a paramedic training course. 
        </p>
  
        <p>
          My restlessness knocked on the door again, and this time, I landed in Berlin, Germany, a place I now call home. Here, my daughter was born, and I feel like I've found the perfect corner to build my future.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          Friends describe me as someone creative, open-minded, and a true survivor who easily adapts to any situation. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I find nothing more gratifying than achieving success as part of a team, feeling valued, and being like a crucial piece of an engine without which nothing would function.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          I'm excited to continue building my story here in Berlin and share every achievement, laugh, and challenge along the way.
        </p>
        <p>
          Open to work on <span>remote, hybrid as well as on site.</span>
        </p>
          
        <p>
          Thanks for stopping by my virtual corner! I hope to meet you soon!
